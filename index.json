As a Teaching Fellow, my role included co-facilitating a weekly lab section, holding office hours and grading homework, as well as mentoring student groups on two long-term projects each semester. Teaching in a nontraditional setting was pivotal to my own development as an educator and helped me formulate the core teaching values I hope to exemplify in my academic career, which can be found in my teaching statement. In 2018 and 2019, I was awarded the White Teaching Prize for excellence in teaching undergraduate physics.\nIn the fall semesters of 2020 and 2021, I served as a Teaching Fellow for Advanced Scientific Computing: Numerical Methods, a graduate-level course taught by Prof. Chris Rycroft that introduces the fundamentals of scientific computing, from data-fitting and optimization to numerical calculus and solutions to systems of differential equations. In addition to holding office hours and grading problem sets, I prepared and led three lessons as part of a groupwork component of the course, and designed accompanying exercises that were completed in groups. Each semester, I closely mentored several student groups on their final projects, providing guidance on their initial proposal, and holding check-ins and advice throughout the process.\nTeaching at Harvard has cultivated my passion for the science of teaching and effective classroom practices as well. As a fourth-year student, I trained as a Pedagogy Fellow through Harvard’s Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning. During this year-long position, I delved into active research topics in science education, attending weekly lessons, as well as participating in and facilitating a pedagogy journal club in the engineering department. I also mentored new graduate Teaching Fellows in their roles by holding microteaching practice sessions, observing lectures or office hours, and holding one-on-one consultations. Finally, I served as Teaching Fellow for the SEAS Teaching Practicum taught by John Girash, a course emphasizing hands-on teaching practice including lesson planning, developing problem sets, giving feedback, and communication.\nIn January of 2020, I helped to design and co-facilitate a winter workshop on the topic of generative art at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology along with three fellow PhD students: Nina Andrejevic, George Varnavides, and Amina Matt. The course emphasized mathematical and natural examples of pattern formation such as fractals, cellular automata, swarming and self-organization, and emergent structure in reaction-diffusion processes. Due to high interest the following year, we resumed in virtual format in 2021, and thoroughly reworked the course material to adapt it to this new setting. We focused on tailoring our code examples to be highly interactive, built in group activities, and developed open-ended design challenges for the students to build upon class examples and showcase their creativity. Developing and leading this course, set to resume in 2022, has been an invaluable opportunity to synthesize the training and practice I\u0026rsquo;ve received.\n","date":1637366400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637366400,"objectID":"be047ea42697489bde7624dddd5f9db1","permalink":"https://jandrejevic12.github.io/teaching/teaching_summary/","publishdate":"2021-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/teaching_summary/","section":"teaching","summary":"My teaching experience during graduate studies has included assisting undergraduate and graduate level courses, developing a student-led mini-course, as well as formal training in effective pedagogy.","tags":null,"title":"Teaching Experience","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"As part of my current research with Prof. Chris Rycroft, I have been developing a large-scale simulation of thin, elastoplastic sheets to aid our study and analysis of crumpling dynamics.

As a familiar example, consider the process of crumpling a sheet of paper into a ball. If the crumpled sheet is opened up, we will observe a complex network of creases where stresses sharply focused during compaction, introducing permanent, plastic deformation. We might ask how the amount of damage introduced varies with the strength of compaction, or how it is distributed spatially across the sheet.\n Crumpling is a ubiquitous phenomenon that can be observed on many different length scales, from the scale of graphene membranes up to the deformation of the earth’s crust. And while crumpling might seem an unwelcome deformation at first glance, the properties of crumpled structures can offer a number of practical advantages due to their porosity, compression-resistance, shapeability, and lightweight nature. One exciting application of crumpling is in the context of batteries and supercapacitors: Crumpled graphene electrodes are shown to have higher electrochemical surface area and resistance to aggregation owing to the high porosity and rigidity of the crumpled state1. From a scientific perspective, crumpling has garnered wide interest due to surprisingly predictable behavior observed amidst this very disordered process. For example, crumpled sheets exhibit slow, or logarithmic relaxation, which can be observed by tracking how the height of a crumpled ball changes after a change in the applied weight2. Crumpled sheets also show predictable memory effects and aging, which is a history dependence in their relaxation3.\nConsider the simple crumpled ball experiment once again. If we crumple the same unfolded sheet a second time, new creases will develop, but we expect the sheet to accumulate less additional damage as it can exploit some of its existing creases during crumpling. A natural question we might ask is whether there is a rule for how such damage accumulates under repeated loading. Building on this idea, the experimental research group of Prof. Shmuel Rubinstein conducted studies of systematic crumpling by compressing a rolled sheet of Mylar with a cylindrical piston to a fixed compaction ratio, unfolding the sheet, and repeating the process. They discovered that when the total crease length accumulated is viewed as a function of crumpling iterations, the growth follows a simple logarithm4:\n$$\\ell(n,\\tilde{\\Delta}) = c_1\\left(1-\\tilde{\\Delta}\\right)\\log\\left(1+c_2\\frac{n}{\\tilde{\\Delta}}\\right).$$\nIn the equation above, $\\ell$ denotes total crease length, $n$ the number of crumpling iterations, and $\\tilde{\\Delta}$ the compaction ratio, which is the ratio of final to initial height of the piston. $c_1$ and $c_2$ are global fitting parameters. Moreover, this trend was robust to varying compaction ratio and initial preparations of the sheet, including pre-folding or hand-crumpling before repeated compaction.\nThe logarithmic scaling was a remarkable reduction of complexity in characterizing crumpling. However, a physical justification for this mathematical model was missing: Can we explain why a logarithmic relationship, in particular, arises from this process? Furthermore, why is the scaling insensitive to the spatial details of the crease network? This motivated our follow-up work to try and explain this on physical grounds5. To do this, we began by recognizing that as a sheet accumulates more creases over time, its surface area remains constant. Thus, rather than observing a quantity that continues to grow over time - the total crease length - we could instead look at a complementary quantity that remains invariant - the sum of individual facet areas. While automated methods were satisfactory, we found it valuable to perform the facet segmentations by hand, to ensure even the smallest facets were identified, and imaging artifacts such as faint or disconnected creases could be corrected. The facet segmentations then allowed us to observe the facet size distribution of each sheet, as well as its evolution over a series of crumples.\n We observed that these characteristic size distributions could be accurately explained by fragmentation theory, which has a rich history in modeling natural breakup phenomena such as the crushing of rock or fragmentation of volcanic debris. Such a fragmentation process can be represented by an integro-differential equation that captures the evolution of the fragment size distribution over time6:\n$$\\frac{\\partial{c(x,t)}}{\\partial{t}}$=-r(x)c(x,t) + \\int_x^{\\infty}r(y)c(y,t)f(x|y)dy$\nIn the equation above, $c(x,t)$ represents the number or concentration of fragments with size $x$ at time $t$, and $r(x)$ and $f(x|y)$ are the overall breakup rate and conditional breakup probability, respectively. With appropriate choices of $r(x)$ and $f(x|y)$ inferred from experimental data, the above equation can be solved exactly, with $c(x,t)$ in agreement with the observed facet size distributions. Building on the fragmentation theory framework, we likewise introduced a model for how the accumulation of damage slows down over repeated crumpling, as the average facet size becomes smaller. This allowed us to explain the logarithmic scaling seen in experiment.\nThe application of fragmentation theory to crumpling is compelling, as it offers a new perspective on a well-studied system while drawing connections to other disordered processes. Future work could explore the extent to which fragmentation theory can more broadly model damage and failure in other systems.\nTo learn more about this project, please see the relevant publications:  A state variable for crumpled thin sheets Cite  DOI     A model for the fragmentation kinetics of crumpled thin sheets Cite  DOI    This research was also featured in:\n The Latest Wrinkle in Crumple Theory - New York Times Rock, Paper, Crumple! - Harvard SEAS News Crumple Theory: We Can Learn a Lot From How Paper Crumples - HowStuffWorks How Paper Crumples - Harvard Magazine Crumple Theory: Top of Mind with Julie Rose, Episode 1576 - BYU Radio    Luo, Jiayan, et al. \u0026ldquo;Compression and aggregation-resistant particles of crumpled soft sheets.\u0026rdquo; ACS Nano 5.11 (2011): 8943-8949.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Amir, Ariel, Yuval Oreg, and Yoseph Imry. \u0026ldquo;On relaxations and aging of various glasses.\u0026rdquo; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 109.6 (2012): 1850-1855.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Lahini, Yoav, et al. \u0026ldquo;Nonmonotonic aging and memory retention in disordered mechanical systems.\u0026rdquo; Physical Review Letters 118.8 (2017): 085501.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Gottesman, Omer, et al. \u0026ldquo;A state variable for crumpled thin sheets.\u0026rdquo; Communications Physics 1.1 (2018): 1-7.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Andrejevic, Jovana, et al. \u0026ldquo;A model for the fragmentation kinetics of crumpled thin sheets.\u0026rdquo; Nature Communications 12.1 (2021): 1-10.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Cheng, Z., and S.
